This chart shows the most common <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram'>n-grams</a>. Specifically, 2-grams, and 3-grams. The y-axis shows the actual n-gram. The x-axis encodes how many times that n-gram is repeated. By default, the top five n-grams are shown.

For data that have been duplicated manually, with minor alterations this chart can help identify them.

### Caveats
* The decimal point is accounted for in the n-gram string, but is not part of the character count.
* When Least Significant Digits is selected, the n-grams will only analyze digits after the decimal point.
