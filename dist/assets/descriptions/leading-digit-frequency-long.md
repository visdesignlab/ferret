##### What to look for:

Analyzing the frequency of leading digits can reveal unexpected patterns. Notably, a divergence from Benford's law can be seen.

##### Caveats:

There are **many scenarios** where Benford's Law **does not apply**. For instance, if data does not span more than one order of magnitude, the leading digit frequency mirrors the distribution of values.
