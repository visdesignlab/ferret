##### What to look for:

Some data that has been fabricated was duplicated values, then made some alterations in an attempt to hide those duplicates. This chart can help identify those cases by counting the number of duplicate sequences of digits, or n-grams.

##### Caveats:

All of the caveats related to duplicate numbers apply to duplicate digits. There are some additional details related to how this analysis works:

-   The decimal point is accounted for in the n-gram string, but is not part of the character count.
-   When Least Significant Digits is selected, the n-grams will only analyze digits after the decimal point.
