Similar to the Frequent Values chart, for data that have been duplicated manually, this chart can help identify them. **However**, there may also be valid explanations for duplicate values in your dataset.

-   There is a small range of possible values compared to the number of data points.
-   The data have been clamped to an upper/lower bound.

### Caveats

-   If your data is recorded as a fraction, we expect the whole number values to be stored, instead of decimal values. For example, we would want 23 seconds instead of 0.3833 minutes, or 7 inches instead of 0.5833 feet. The reason for this is to provide a more accurate representation for the range of possible values.
