##### What to look for:

We assume inconspicuous data has similar precision for similar observations. Time measured with a stopwatch, for example, would typically have a precision of up to 1/100 of a second. Most numbers should have two digits after the decimal points, a few with one digit (e.g., exactly 3.1 seconds), and even fewer numbers with no digits (3 seconds). Manipulated data may have extremely varied precision. This could happen if data is recorded (or generated) with a high degree of precision, then manually manipulated to change some values. Alternatively, some authentic data could be collected with limited precision, and a function with high precision could be used to generate the rest.

##### Caveats:

A large variation of precision could also arise in innocent ways, like in converting between fractions and decimals. For instance, if the length of an animal is recorded in inches, then converted to feet, it would be expected to see high-precision decimals like X.33333333 and X.58333333 as well as low-precision numbers like X.5 and X.25. Also, sometimes floating point representations of numbers can cause very high precision. For instance, 3.1 may appear as 3.0999999999999 or 3.1000000000001.
