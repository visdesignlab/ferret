##### What to look for:

In some situations, the last digit of a collection of measurements might represent a randomly sampled uniform distribution. In other situations, different patterns would be expected. For example, in a list of prices for grocery-store products, an increased frequency in the digit nine would be expected since prices ending with 99 are strategically selected to make a product appear cheaper. On the other hand, if people are asked to provide an estimate for a value, we expect a final digit of zero to be more frequent than other digits. For example, if participants at a large event were asked how many people attended, we would expect an answer of 15,000 to be much more common than 14,872. We consider a trailing digits artifact to be a mismatch between the expected pattern of the last digit and the pattern observed in the data or an unexplained inconsistency of trailing digits between parts of a dataset.
