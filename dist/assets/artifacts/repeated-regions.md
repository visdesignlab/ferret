While six duplicate numbers may be considered a weak signal of manipulation, two identical sequences of six numbers are a much stronger one. We consider a region to consist of multiple cell values that have a spatial relationship in a spreadsheet. While the simplest example is a sequence of numbers in a column, regions include adjacent patterns, vertically or horizontally, and may include gaps. Repeated regions can be artifacts of manipulation. While some repeated regions could be caused by how the data is collected, such an innocuous structure is likely obvious.
