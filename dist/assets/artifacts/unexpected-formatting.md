##### What to look for:

A variation in formatting, especially within a single column, can be an indication there are problems with the data. These problems could be the result of clerical errors, or data processing done in another spreadsheet with different formatting, then copied back to the main spreadsheet.

##### Caveats:

In some cases, a variation of formatting is expected. Different types of data formats (numerical, string, etc) in columns are common. Also, sometimes certain data values are highlighted to make them easier to notice in the source dataset. Unusual formatting could be the result of valid processing or unintentional errors.
